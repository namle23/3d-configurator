A project using React/Redux and ThreeJS to build a dynamic 3D
configurator from JSON. Each model has many instances and will be
shown when user clicks on each part of the model. Instances will be
displayed in 3D format as well. This configurator let user imports
their own JSON file (this JSON file has to follow a certain format)
and the configurator will display those 3D model of products
(including prices, name, code,...) automatically. Users also can
modify the components from the original product (display in 3D
format) according to their need.
